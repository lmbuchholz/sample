Sample Work


This contains two assignments from my software development program that show my understanding of several important programming topics, including objects/classes, the static keyword, interfaces, and inheritance. I've also included a sample of some JUnit tests that I developed, as well as my professor's specifications for the assignments. 

The following files correspond with the following assignments (each file also indicates this information in the comments):
